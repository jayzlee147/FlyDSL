"""Stable scheduling classes for dynamic expert-major SonicMoE routes.

The local route count is data dependent under expert parallelism.  It is a
valid runtime extent, but it is a poor compiler or launch-topology key: nearby
ranks can otherwise select different kernels immediately before a collective.
This module deliberately separates the *policy size* used for coarse tuning
from every allocation bound and from the exact runtime route count.

Callers which coordinate expert-parallel ranks may pass the same
``route_policy_size`` on every rank (normally a conservative nominal per-rank
route count).  The hint is a policy floor rather than an unsafe upper bound:
an unexpectedly larger local shard is promoted automatically.  Without a
hint we place the local count in one of four broad capacity classes.  The
final class is open ended, so arbitrarily large legal route counts do not
create further policy or JIT variants.
